SilverStripe 3 Designs
======================

This repository is being used to track the development of SilverStripe 3 design work that won't actually become part of the final product.  Once we actually start producing functional templates, we should start checking things into the silverstripe-cms project.  Mainly, this repository will contain HTML/CSS/JS mock-ups, but PNGs or PSDs could go here too.
